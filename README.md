### 💀 About This Lost Soul

Greetings, fellow code warriors and digital nomads. I'm a third-year Computer Science student at PHCET - yes, that's right, a Tier 3 college so underground it's practically in the Earth's core. But hey, diamonds are formed under pressure, and I'm pretty sure my code is at least coal-quality by now.

I'm currently trapped in the beautiful chaos of becoming a tech enthusiast who's obsessed with making servers cry and containers behave. Some say I'm a masochist; I prefer "DevOps enthusiast."

### 🔧 My Arsenal of Digital Destruction

**Frontend Sorcery:**
- React.js ⚛️ (Making components that actually work, revolutionary!)
- Next.js 🚀 (Because why render on the client when you can confuse everyone with SSR?)
- TypeScript 📝 (JavaScript with trust issues, just like me)

**Backend Wizardry:**
- Node.js 🟢 (Single-threaded like my dating life)
- Express.js 🚂 (Fast, minimal, and gets the job done)
- MongoDB 🍃 (NoSQL because relationships are complicated)

**The MERN Stack:** My weapon of choice for building full-stack applications that occasionally work on the first try.

**Current Obsession: DevOps** 🐳
- Docker (Containerizing my problems since 2024)
- Kubernetes (Because one container is never enough)
- CI/CD Pipelines (Automating my way to unemployment)
- AWS/Cloud Services (Burning money in the cloud)
- Infrastructure as Code (Because clicking buttons is for peasants)

### 🎭 My Origin Story

Born and raised in the digital trenches of PHCET, where the WiFi is slow, the labs are ancient, and the printers work about as often as my code on production. But like a phoenix rising from the ashes of segmentation faults and 404 errors, I've emerged with:

- An unhealthy relationship with Stack Overflow
- The ability to debug code at 3 AM while questioning my life choices
- A growing fascination with making things work automagically (that's DevOps for you)
- Enough caffeine in my bloodstream to power a small server

---

### 🌙 What Keeps Me Up at Night (Besides Bugs)

1. **DevOps Evangelism**: Converting developers to the dark side of infrastructure automation
2. **Container Orchestration**: Making Docker containers dance in harmony
3. **Pipeline Optimization**: Because waiting 30 minutes for a build is basically torture
4. **Infrastructure Monitoring**: Watching servers like a hawk watching its prey
5. **The eternal question**: "Is it DNS?" (Spoiler: It's always DNS)

---

### 🎯 Mission Statement

*"To boldly deploy where no code has deployed before, and to make production environments slightly less terrifying, one pipeline at a time."*

Currently on a quest to:
- Master the art of Infrastructure as Code
- Become a Kubernetes whisperer
- Survive my third year without having a complete mental breakdown
- Land a DevOps role where I can break production professionally

### 💭 Random Thoughts & Dark Humor

- "There are only 10 types of people in this world: those who understand binary and those who don't."
- "I don't always test my code, but when I do, I do it in production."
- "Why do programmers prefer dark mode? Because light attracts bugs!"
- "My code doesn't always work, but when it does, I have no idea why."
- "Docker: Solving problems you didn't know you had in ways you don't understand."

### 🔮 Future Goals (If I Survive)

- [ ] Become a DevOps Engineer (preferably before my student loans kill me)
- [ ] Master Kubernetes (and maybe understand what it actually does)
- [ ] Build infrastructure that doesn't collapse under pressure
- [ ] Graduate from Tier 3 college with Tier 1 skills
- [ ] Write code that my future self won't curse at
- [ ] Achieve the mythical "one-click deployment"
